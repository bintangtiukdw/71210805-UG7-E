And then you leave me all behind
And you say, "Don't come back again"
And I said

Why would I come back to you
If you don't need me to?
I'll be losing you
And you'll be losing me

Time passing by you come back again
You say you're sorry for what you've done
But how many times have we made the same mistakes?
How make times does it takes to forgive you
Again and again, mmm
And then you start hurting me, hurting me
Pushing me away from you
